              I believe there are so many things in this world that are yet to
              be done and so many new stories to be told. My goal in life is to

              I am a developer based in Minnesota, focused on advancing my
              career farther into the development field. I am currently
              attending a full stack course at the University of Minnesota, with
              the intention on graduating as a junior full stack web developer.
              I absolutely love people, I love working with them, being around
              them, and leading them. Coming form 5 years of customer service
              and management background I would say I have had a decent share of
              just about everything in some shape or form.{" "}
